Today I worked on my Profile project and how to integrate the boot strap. I renamed my folders and files. I also began moving over elements of the boot strap to other files for my liking. I should have the project done soon when I put in my awards.

This week we got assigned our Profile project. I have downloaded the bootstrap file to organize our page for it. Once I get the file in my profile I will have to edit the format to fit my style. I also finished up my pizza project this week. I put in the remainder of the divs and other things but still struggled to get my pictures to show up. However I did get the divs in which was a step up from before.

RThis week we started a pet project where we have to create a page on putty to transfer to our chrome web browser. I added things to do to my trello board. We downloaded a new program called SCPWin. This program is to help us move pictures onto our page about our pet. I also picked the language I will use for my google friday project.

This week we mainly just worked on our XML project. It helped us to be able to type code quickly so we will be ready for our google friday project. The reason we started with XML because it is very similar to HTML so it will not be that hard when we have to use it. We also learned how to sort the different things with the commands in XML.

This week we talked about XML. WE talked about how it is a mark-up language and how that is different from a mark-down language. We learned more about git hub. We figured out how to add all of our reflections in to putty and transfer it into git hub. Now we can add anything that we have made into git hub for our project.

This week we learned all sorts of new commands for putty. I think this will be a building block for more advanced things to come. The next thing we did was linking our git hub account with putty so we can transfer our projects in. I think I will be ready for more difficult things as I completed the project with relative ease. With our accounts now we are ready to learn how to do our Google Friday projects.
