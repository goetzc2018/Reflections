This week we worked heavily on our pizza project. We talked a little bit about about boot strap and how to implement it. We had to add pictures onto our pizza project. We were taught how to layout our pizza projects to make them look nic and proffesional. We also worked on our google friday. I spent a lot of time trying to learn to make python for google friday.

This week in class we talked and learned some more about Bitcoin at the beginning of the week. After that we kind of drifted off and talked about quantum computers. Another thing we went into was hash and the different codes used. Some have been broken in the past and it led to problems. Bitcoins hash has still never been broken even though it has been solved before. We also went over coding and the different kinds. We downloaded putty and just started messing around with different commands.

This week I learned more about how messages and certain things get transferred from on computer to another. We reviewed how IP addresses work and how important they are. We talked about how agar.io would have a server and be able to send messages to everyone. One of the analogies we used was how computer messaging it is very similar to how to real mail travels from one home to another. We also went back over different types of algorithms. We talked about how constant would always be faster in the long run no matter how close the other ones got.

This week in computer fundamentals 2 we pretty much just reviewed to make sure everyone was prepared to take the class. One thing we went back over was big O. We talked about which types of algorithms were the fastest and which ones are the slowest. We talked about several situations in real life where a constant big O equation could be applied. We also went over the basics of the new class and what we will need to be prepared. At the beginning of the week we quickly refreshed binary because it will be an important factor in the future of this class.
